This homework assigment was really hard for me. It took me a while to figure what to do and how to do it.
In the end of the day I think that unit test was the hardest part for me. Also, along the road
I feel like my code can be improved a lot. Comments are not as good as they are suppose simply 
becuase english is not my native lagunage. I want to mention that I was not able to figure out 
how to check the line intersection.
